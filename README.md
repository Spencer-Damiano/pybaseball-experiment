# Overview

I saw a reddit post that the 2023 Atlanta Braves were using some kind of 'sign stealing' which allowed the Braves Ronald Acuna and Matt Olsen to have MVP caliber seasons. The accusation is this, The Braves are 'stealing signs' and are relaying this information through a wistle to their batters. This is hard to prove because one its the automatic response of butt hurt teams and two do to the new pitch com system (bluetooth device that allows catchers and pitchers to communicate). To get enough evidence to prove that something is going on I came up with 3 ways you could try prove this:

1. Rewatch the games, note every time a whistle is heard on offense, the pitch thrown, and the result.
1. Bring a whistle to the game an blow it randomly and see if the hitters get confused.
1. Intercept and decode the pitch com signals

As much as I would like to do all three of those I do not have the time to. Instead I am going to compare the 2017 Huston Astros home and away batting averages with every other teams averages to see if there is a noticeable difference and then see if the 2023 Atlanta Braves experienced a similar benefit. If they did I might look into the above options.
