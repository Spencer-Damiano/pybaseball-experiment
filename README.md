# Overview

I wanted to see if there was a significant impact on the new playoff formate in baseball. For those who aren't familiar the MLB expanded its playoff this season. as a result three out of four teams that took a one week bye got knocked out of the playoffs. I am trying to see if that being iced for a week showed a negative impact cause directly by having this time off. To do this I will be using pybaseball library to get the statistics of the batters and check to see if the time off had a negative impact. 

My Null Hypothesis is: The impact of not playing for a week is not statistically significance and had no provable impact on postseason performance.

Alternative Hypothesis is: The impact of not playing for a week was statistically significance and had a provable impact on postseason performance

My Significance level is $\alpha = 5\%$
